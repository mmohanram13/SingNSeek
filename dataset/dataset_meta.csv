Best Thing,best-thing.mp3,AiCanvas,Pixabay,2023,Rhythm and Blues,AiCanvas,AiCanvas,"The best thing I don't have, you have to be, the biggest thing I miss, I don't wanna wait. I search for answers I don't find, in a way I can make your mind, roads I walk far from home, every step alone. I don't wanna be missing you, I don't wanna be hurt, I don't wanna be crying tears, it won't bring you here, I want this game to be over, I want it all back, can't wait for it to end. I don't wanna be missing you, I don't wanna be hurt, I don't wanna be crying tears, it won't bring you here, I want this game to be over, I want it all back, can't wait for it to end.

I'm Hollow,im-hollow.mp3,u_1gnk67ajn8,Pixabay,2021,Pop,u_1gnk67ajn8,u_1gnk67ajn8,"In the stillness of the night, I hear you call, every whisper echoes down these empty halls. The shadows dance with memories too bright to fade, the leaves fall gently from the branches of the life we made. There's a fire within, though the cold winds blow, I'll find the truth in dreams, where only we can go. I am hollow, but still alive and breathing, carved deep with scars, yet my heart still believing. Holding on to flames, burning bright in the dark, even in this fire, I'll keep searching for a spot. Scarred and weary, this heart still beats alone, each breath testament to the love we've outgrown. Loose hold tighter, wrestling against the storm, though the world feels hollow, somehow stay warm. Letting go, but still I grasp your fading light in this emptiness, I'll fight through the night. I am hollow, but still alive and breathing, carved deep with scars, yet my heart still believing. Holding on to flames, burning bright in the dark, even in this void, I'll keep searching for a spot. So I'll carry you with me, through the vast unknown, in the echoes of my soul, you'll never be alone."
